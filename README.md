ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! I'm Yuki, a self-proclaimed coding wizard and professional procrastinator. Welcome to the weird and wonderful world of my hub!

Bout' Me
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently juggling too many projects at once, but hey, multitasking is my middle name! (and procrastinator as well...)
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to procrastinate more efficiently... I mean, mastering Python.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the mysteries of the universe... or maybe just coding stuff.
ðŸ“« How to reach me: Send a carrier pigeon... or just use tzer0yuki@gmail.com.
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His (but I also answer to "Your Majesty").
âš¡ Fun fact: I speak three languages: English, Sarcasm, and Portuguese.

Skills
Programming Languages: Proficient in Python, fluent in memes.
Tools & Platforms: I know how to use the Library of Babel.

Projects
Here are some of the projects I'm proud of (when I'm not binge-watching Netflix):

Bio-logica: This project uses a constant stream of coffee to work, I did it cause of a school project (I started 24h before the due time).
Namorofujao: Warning: may contain traces of (bad) humor and code, seriously, it's a project that I wanted to use with my girlfriend, but then I remembered that I don't have a girlfriend.

Let's Connect
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-yuki-ishikiriyama-7018a9192/): Because even wizards need a professional profile.
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/T_Z3r0y): Where I share my thoughts in 280 characters or less... mostly less (jk, mostly more, way more).

Feel free to explore my repositories and join me on this crazy coding adventure! Remember, the code is strong with this one.
